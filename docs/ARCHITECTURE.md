# Architecture Overview

## System Components

Remembot is built as a modern, scalable application with the following key components:

### 1. iMessage Integration Layer

- Handles communication with Apple's Messages framework
- Processes incoming messages and commands
- Manages message formatting and responses
- Implements natural language processing for task creation

### 2. Backend Services

- RESTful API server built with Node.js
- Task management and storage
- User authentication and session management
- Reminder scheduling system

### 3. Database Layer

- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Task and user data models

### 4. External Services Integration

- Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for reminders
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) services
- Cloud storage for media attachments

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**

   - User sends message to Remembot
   - iMessage Integration Layer receives and parses message
   - NLP processes message intent

2. **Task Processing**

   - Backend validates and processes task
   - Database operations are performed
   - Response is formatted

3. **Notification Flow**
   - Reminder triggers are scheduled
   - APNs sends notifications
   - User receives reminder via iMessage

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Secure storage of user credentials
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Regular security audits

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of backend services
- Load balancing for API servers
- Database sharding strategy
- Caching layer for performance

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging system
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- Usage analytics

## Development Environment

- Local development setup
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- Staging environment

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized services
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Cloud infrastructure
- Backup and recovery procedures
